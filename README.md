## Cortex Nano Bridge

This library is meant to be a lightweight bridge between the VEX V5 or Cortex systems and the Jetson (Orin) Nano. Note that different versions of Jetson and VEX systems have different library support and behaviors, and unfortunately that means that this guide will be quite involved. However, once you are able to set up the bridge, creating your robot code should be straightforward.

### Getting Started
Follow the [Jetson Orin Nano guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit) or the [Jetson Nano guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit). Remember to set "log in automatically" instead of "require my password to log in". Set power usage to 15W (Jetson Orin Nano) or MAXN (Jetson Nano). Expand storage to max size as shown (ie. 59300).

### Jetson Package Installation

Once you are logged in, open a Terminal, and type in the update cmds below. You can select (Y) for most of the options. You don't have to restart docker daemon.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, install librealsense by following [these steps (1, 2, 3)](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation_jetson.md#4-install-with-debian-packages). Then open a new Terminal and type of the following:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools packaging
sudo pip3 install pyserial numpy requests
# only for Jetson Orin Nano, as the older Jetson Nano fails:
sudo pip3 install opencv-python pyrealsense2
```

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/timrobot/CortexNanoBridge) to the Jetson, navigate to the `jetson_nano/` folder and run the installer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timrobot/CortexNanoBridge.git
cd CortexNanoBridge/jetson_nano
sudo bash ./install.sh
sudo reboot
```

You have finished installing the software on the Jetson, now to install the software on the microcontroller.

### VEX Microcontroller Installation

In addition to installing the library on the Jetson Nano, we will need to push comms code to the robot controller. On your laptop or desktop, clone [this repo](https://github.com/timrobot/CortexNanoBridge) so that we can upload the comms code. You will only have to do this once.

#### V5 Brain
1. Install the [VEX Extension for VSCode](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/vscode-extension), as well as the C/C++ extensions from Microsoft. Connect a microusb cable to the V5 Brain, and update firmware. You may need to update and restart VSCode a couple of times.
2. Create a new VEX Project > V5 > C/C++ > Clawbot Template (Motors). Copy `CortexNanoBridge/vex_v5/src/main.cpp` to the new project's `src/` folder. If you accidentally selected the wrong initial template, that's okay - just copy over all the files in `src/` and `include/`. **Build and download** the code to the V5 Brain, and disconnect the microusb cable.
3. Plug in the RS485 cables on ports 19 and 20, and plug in their USBs into the Jetson. Run the application from the V5 Brain screen.

#### VEX Cortex
1. Install the [RobotC GUI](https://www.robotc.net/). Connect a usb cable to the Cortex, and update firmware. Remember to select (USB only) mode from the communication style menu.
2. Open `CortexNanoBridge/vex_cortex/main_app.c`. Compile and download the code to the Cortex, and disconnect the usb cable.
3. Wire the UART Cable to the UART1 pins on the Cortex, and plug in the USB into the Jetson.

Congratulations, you have finished setting everything up for the bridge! üëè

## Running Basic Code

#### Jetson Orin Nano (Local Control)

Remember to plug in your Realsense camera into the robot if you wish to get the color and depth frames.

```python
from cortano import VexV5, RealsenseCamera

if __name__ == "__main__":
  realsense = RealsenseCamera()
  robot = VexV5()

  while robot.running():
    color, depth = realsense.read()
    sensors, battery = robot.sensors()
    robot.motor[0] = 0 # you can set this to any value from -100 to 100
    robot.motor[9] = 0
```

If you want to use the VexV5Controller, you can get the values via the controller bridge:

```python
from cortano import VexV5, RealsenseCamera

if __name__ == "__main__":
  realsense = RealsenseCamera()
  robot = VexV5()

  while robot.running():
    color, depth = realsense.read()
    sensors, battery = robot.sensors()
    left = robot.controller.Axis3
    right = robot.controller.Axis2
    robot.motor[0] = left
    robot.motor[9] = right
```
